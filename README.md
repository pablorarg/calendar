# Calendar

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & made with â™¥

## Description

This simple calendar allows you to create and manage Events on dates.

## I have used

* Context api & * Reducer api to manage global state of calendar & events.
* Custom hooks
* Intl js api to manage dates & days names
* uuid to manege unique identifiers
* localStorage to store events data.

## You can:
* Navigate through the calendar & see events (if there are created). 
* Create & delete Events

1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm install` command.
3. Run `npm start` command.
